    <h1><a href="https://github.com/domino-clj/domino">Domino</a></h1>

    <p>
      Domino is a data flow engine that helps you organize the interactions between your data model and events. Domino allows
    you to declare your business logic using a directed acyclic graph of events and effects. Whenever an external change is
    transacted to the data model, the graph determines the chain of events that will be executed, and side effects triggered
    as a result of the computation.
  </p>

    <p>
      Without a way to formalize the interactions between different parts of the application, relationships in code become implicit.
      This results in code that's difficult to maintain because of the mental overhead involved in tracking these relationships.
      Domino makes the interactions between pieces of business logic explicit and centralized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Domino explicitly separates logic that makes changes to the data model from side effectful functions. Business logic
    functions in Domino explicitly declare how they interact with the data model by declaring their inputs and outputs.
    Domino then uses these declarations to build a graphs of related events. This approach handles cascading business logic
    out of the box, and provides a data specification for relationships in code. Once the changes are transacted, the
    effectful functions are called against the new state.
  </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>

    <strong>1. Require <code>domino.core</code></strong>

      <pre><code
       class="lang-eval-clojure"
       data-external-libs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domino-clj/domino/master/src">
       (require '[domino.core :as domino])
      </code></pre>

    <strong>2. Declare your schema</strong>

    <p>Let's take a look at a simple engine that accumulates a total. Whenever an amount is set, this value is added to the
    current value of the total. If the total exceeds <code>1337</code> at any point, it prints out a statement that says <code>"Woah. That's a
    lot."</code></p>

    <pre><code
       class="lang-eval-clojure">
      (def schema
        {:model   [[:amount {:id :amount}]
                    [:total {:id :total}]]
        :events  [{:inputs  [:amount]
                    :outputs [:total]
                    :handler (fn [ctx [amount] [total]]
                                [(+ total amount)])}]
        :effects [{:inputs [:total]
                    :handler (fn [ctx [total]]
                                (when (> total 1337)
                                (js/alert "Woah. That's a lot.")))}]})
    </code></pre>

  <p>
    This <code>schema</code> declaration is a map containing three keys:

    <ul>
     <li>The <code>:model</code> key declares the shape of the data
    model used by Domino.</li>
    <li>The <code>:events</code> key contains pure functions that represent events that are triggered when their inputs change.
      The events produce updated values that are persisted in the state.</li>
    <li>The <code>:effects</code> key contains the functions that produce side effects based on the updated state.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Using a unified model referenced by the event functions allows us to easily tell how a particular piece of business logic is triggered.
    The event engine generates a direct acyclic graph (DAG) based on the <code>:input</code> keys declared by each event that's used to
    compute the new state in a transaction. This approach removes any ambiguity regarding when and how business logic is executed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Domino explicitly separates the code that modifies the state of the data from the code that causes side effects. This encourages
    keeping business logic pure and keeping the effects at the edges of the application.
  </p>

    <strong>3. Initialize the engine</strong>

    <p>
      The <code>schema</code> that we declared above provides a specification for the internal data model and the code that operates on
      it. Once we've created a schema, we will need to initialize the data flow engine.
      This is done by calling the <code>domino/initialize!</code> function. This function can be called by providing a schema along with
      an optional initial state map. In our example, we will give it the <code>schema</code> that we defined above,
      and an initial value for the state with the <code>:total</code> set to <code>0</code>.</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-eval-clojure">
      (def ctx (atom (domino/initialize! schema {:total 0})))
    </code></pre>

    <p>Calling the <code>initialize!</code> function creates a context <code>ctx</code> that's used as the initial state for the engine.
      The context will contain the model, events, effects, event graph, and db (state). In our example we use an atom in order to easily
      update the state of the engine.</p>

    <strong>4. Transact your external data changes</strong>

    <p>
      We can update the state of the data by calling <code>domino/transact</code> that accepts the current <code>ctx</code> along with an inputs
    vector, returning the updated <code>ctx</code>. The input vector is a collection of path-value pairs. For example, to set the
    value of <code>:amount</code> to <code>10</code>, you would pass in the following input vector <code>[[[:amount] 10]]</code>.
  </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-eval-clojure">
      (swap! ctx domino/transact [[[:amount] 10]])
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      The updated <code>ctx</code> contains the <code>:change-history</code> which is a simple vector of all the changes as they were applied to the
    data in exectution order of the events that were triggered.
  </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-eval-clojure">
      (:change-history @ctx)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      We can see the new context contains the updated total amount and the change history shows the order in which the changes
    were applied.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>:domino.core/db</code> key in the context will contain the updates state reflecting the changes applied by running the events.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="lang-eval-clojure">
    (:domino.core/db @ctx)
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Finally, let's update the <code>:amount</code> to a value that triggers an effect.
  </p>
  
<pre><code class="lang-eval-clojure"
           data-preamble="(require '[reagent.core :as reagent])">
  (defn button []
    [:button
     {:on-click #(swap! ctx domino/transact [[[:amount] 2000]])}
     "trigger effect"])
  
  (reagent/render-component [button] js/klipse-container)
    </code></pre>
